  #USCM roleplay standards
  - Don't openly try to cooperate with obvious or known hostile forces as a crew member.
  - All personnel employed by the USCM or contracted by Nanotrasen to the USCM are mentally stable and fit for duty.
  - USCM has knowledge of all possible threats.
  - USCM is not yet aware there are xenos on the planet

  ##Ship modifications
  - Deconstruction of the ship for materials should not be occuring before first drop. The marines would not immediately resort to taking their warship to pieces for a random unconfirmed distress call.
  - Includes salvaging of things like chairs in briefing, however does not include the barrels and crates in maintenance.
  - Includes the removal of supplies from the ship where not explicitly necessary. You would not drag half the contents of the medical bay to the field immediately.
  - Modifications to the ship should not be made with meta-purposes, do not build a maze or bunker on the ship intended to secure the ship for hijack before you even know hijack is a thing.
